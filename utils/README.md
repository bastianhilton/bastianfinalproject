Utils:

Utils (short for utilities) are simple JavaScript functions or modules that provide helper functionality.

They are not tied to Vue or Nuxt specifically and can be used in any JavaScript project.

Utils are not reactive by default and are typically used for pure, side-effect-free operations, such as data transformations, formatting, or calculations.

They are often used to abstract away repetitive or complex tasks, making the codebase more readable and maintainable.

Utils can be imported and used in composables, components, or anywhere else in your Nuxt application.

In summary, utils are more appropriate for simpler, pure functions.
