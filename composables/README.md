Composables:

Composables are a new feature introduced in Vue 3 and Nuxt 3.

They are essentially reusable Vue composition functions that can be imported and used in multiple components or other composables.

Composables can leverage Vue's Composition API, making it easier to manage reactive state, lifecycle hooks, and other Vue features.

They are designed to be fully reactive, meaning that any changes to the data they depend on will automatically trigger updates in the components using them.

Composables are typically used to encapsulate complex logic, such as data fetching, state management, or event handling.

In summary, composables are a Vue-specific feature that leverages the Composition API to provide reusable, reactive logic, while utils are general-purpose helper functions that can be used in any JavaScript project, including Nuxt applications. Composables are better suited for encapsulating complex, reactive logic.
